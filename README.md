# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This project is a React-based web application designed to allow users to upload PDF documents and ask AI-powered questions about their content.

## Components
The project consists of two main components:
The frontend is built using React, providing a clean user interface where users can upload PDF files and submit their questions.
The backend is powered by Node.js and Express, handling file uploads and AI question-answering functionality. The core technology utilizes the LangChain framework combined with OpenAI's API, implementing the following workflow:

## Workflow
When a user uploads a PDF, the system extracts and splits the content into smaller chunks.
These text chunks are converted into vectors using OpenAI's embedding model.
When a user asks a question, the system identifies the most relevant text chunks.
The GPT model (gpt-3.5-turbo) then generates an answer based on these relevant sections.
This approach enables the AI to provide answers specific to the document content rather than generic responses. Using "RAG" combining the strengths of document retrieval and generative AI to deliver more accurate and targeted answers.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
